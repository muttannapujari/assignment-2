        <h1 style="text-align:center;">cloud computing</h1>

        <p>The clients on your end user’s desks are how you will interact 
            with the cloud.In this section we’ll talk about the different 
            types of clients and how they can be configured to communicate
             with the cloud.There are different types of clients that can link
              <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the cloud.Each one offers a different way for you to interact with your data and applications.
        	Depending on your organization and its needs, you may find yourself using any combination of these devices •	It is Another security benefit isn’t so much a technology
            It is transfer of resources computational task to a separate processor or platform or to cloud.
            Offloading to a coprocessor can be used to accelerate applications including; image rendering and mathematical calculations.
            Offloading computing to an external platform over a network can provide computing power and overcome hardware limitations of a device, such as limited computational power, storage, and energy.
            It’s up to the cloud provider to provide adequate security
            The fact of the matter is that your cloud provider might offer more security features than you had before.
            The fact that so many clients are paying allows cloud providers to have bigger security, simply because of the economy of scale involved.
            Logging
            <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also called Logging as a service (LaaS).
            logging is the process of collecting and storing data over a period of time in order to analyze specific trends or record the data-based events/actions of a system, network or IT environment.
            It is collecting any type of log files coming from any given source or location such as servers, applications, devices etc.
            logging enables the recording of activity performed on one or more data/file objects or sets.
            dat logging records events/actions, such as the data's size, most recent modification and username/name of the individual that modified the data.
            logging also facilitates the storage and collection of computer or device information.
            logging also allows information security (IS) and auditing staff to analyze system access information and assess audit trails to trace viruses and identify suspicious activities.
            In the cloud, you have to contend with large volumes of log data. Your log data may be extra- complex because different cloud providers or services use different formats. And your logs may be spread across a distributed architecture.
            o	How can we deal with these challenges?
            Logging is also improved. It’s something that, in-house, usually gets the short end of the stick. But in the virtualized world of cloud computing, providers can add as much memory as they need to extend logging.
            <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Forensics- scientific tests or techniques used in connection with the detection of crime
            If there is a breach, the cloud provider can respond to the incident with less downtime than if you had to investigate the breach locally.
            It is easy to build a forensic server online, and it costs almost nothing until it comes into use.
            Clod Forensics is actually an application within Digital Forensics which oversees the crime committed over the cloud and investigates on it.
            If there is a problem, the virtual machine can be cloned for easy offline analysis.
            
            Further, many companies don’t have a dedicated in-house incident response team. Development
            Even more good news is that security vendors are not in the dark about this whole cloud thing.
            They are actively developing products that can apply to virtual machines and the cloud.
            Security vendors also have a unique opportunity in the cloud.
            Auditing
            It is the responsibility of the auditor to report on all the risks an organization may face.
            Following are some points that an auditor have to consider while performing an audit of the organization who uses cloud for storage and processing of data:-
            •	Auditor have to verify that only authorized individuals have access to cloud computing resources based on their roles and responsibilities.
            Auditor have to check about the type and sensitivity of data stored in the cloud. As loss, leakage or unavailability of data can cause loss to business
            Auditor have to check the risk associated with the change of technology. How the new technology is adopted and what are the benefits users
            Auditor have to verify the sufficiency and appropriateness of policies, practices and procedures for the protection of data stored in the cloud.
            Auditor have to review the terms of Service level Agreement (SLA) for the protection of data stored on the cloud.
            Auditor have to assure that confidential and sensitive data should be encrypted in the cloud.
            Auditor have to go through the access logs and assure the protection of access logs from inadvertent deletion or unauthorized access.
            <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Auditor have to assure that if there is any lack of policy and procedures for appropriate handling of security and privacy incidents.
            Auditor have to assure that password settings are strong at cloud and according to the organizational policies
            •	there is the headache of securing your own local network.
            But when you send your data to the cloud, a whole new set of issues arise.
            •	This is largely because your data is being stored on someone else’s equipment.
            The goal of CloudAudit is to provide cloud service providers with a way to make their performance and security data readily available for potential customers.
            
            Compliance-Agreement /standards
            Compliance adds another level of headache.
            The term 'cloud compliance’ can relate to many different industry standards and regulations that cloud customers need to comply with.
            For example, in the healthcare industry, a set of laws called HIPAA make strict guidelines and security protocols mandatory for certain kinds of patient health data.
            Another example is new financial privacy regulations that have stemmed from changes in the finance world over the last couple of decades.
            Cloud customer will figure out whether their cloud vendor services match the compliance that they need.
            In assessing cloud security, experts suggest that cloud customers ask certain kinds of questions, such as -- where is the data going to be stored? And who will be able to access it?
            
            Cloud compliance will remain an issue as engineers and designers work on how to provide the most secure and best options for customers.
            compliance could be managed by a few tasks:
            Identify users and access privileges.
            Identify sensitive data,
            Identify where it’s located.
            Identify how it is encrypted.
            Document this for auditors and regulators,
